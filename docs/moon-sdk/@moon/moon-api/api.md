# API Reference

## `MoonApi`

The `MoonApi` class provides a set of methods for interacting with the Moon API.

### `constructor(config: MoonSDKConfig)`

Creates a new instance of the `MoonApi` class.

#### Parameters

- `config` (`MoonSDKConfig`): An object that contains configuration options for the `MoonApi` instance.

#### Example

```typescript
import { MoonApi } from '@moonup/moon-api';

const moonApi = new MoonApi({
  Auth: {
    securityWorker: () => Promise.resolve('test'),
  },
});
```

### `getAccount(address: string): Promise<AccountResponse>`

Retrieves information about an account.

#### Parameters

- `address` (`string`): The Ethereum address of the account to retrieve information about.

#### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to an `AccountResponse` object.

#### Example

```typescript
const account = await moonApi.getAccount('0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890');
console.log(account);
```

### `sendTransaction(transaction: Transaction): Promise<TransactionResponse>`

Sends a transaction to the Moon API.

#### Parameters

- `transaction` (`Transaction`): An object that contains information about the transaction to send.

#### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to a `TransactionResponse` object.

#### Example

```typescript
const transaction: Transaction = {
  to: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
  value: BigNumber.from('1000000000000000000'),
};

const response = await moonApi.sendTransaction(transaction);
console.log(response);
```

## `MoonSDKConfig`

The `MoonSDKConfig` interface defines the configuration options for a `MoonApi` instance.

### Properties

- `Auth` (`{ securityWorker: () => Promise<string> }`): An object that contains a `securityWorker` function, which is used to authenticate requests to the Moon API.

## `AccountResponse`

The `AccountResponse` interface defines the structure of the response object returned by the `getAccount` method.

### Properties

- `address` (`string`): The Ethereum address of the account.
- `balance` (`BigNumber`): The balance of the account.
- `nonce` (`number`): The nonce of the account.
- `transactions` (`Transaction[]`): An array of `Transaction` objects representing the transactions associated with the account.

## `Transaction`

The `Transaction` interface defines the structure of an object that contains information about a transaction.

### Properties

- `to` (`string`): The Ethereum address of the recipient of the transaction.
- `value` (`BigNumber`): The value of the transaction in wei.
- `data` (`BytesLike`): The data to include in the transaction.
- `gasLimit` (`BigNumber`): The gas limit for the transaction.
- `gasPrice` (`BigNumber`): The gas price for the transaction.
- `nonce` (`number`): The nonce for the transaction.

## `TransactionResponse`

The `TransactionResponse` interface defines the structure of the response object returned by the `sendTransaction` method.

### Properties

- `hash` (`string`): The hash of the transaction.
- `nonce` (`number`): The nonce of the transaction.
- `blockHash` (`string`): The hash of the block containing the transaction.
- `blockNumber` (`number`): The number of the block containing the transaction.
- `transactionIndex` (`number`): The index of the transaction in the block.
- `from` (`string`): The Ethereum address of the sender of the transaction.
- `to` (`string`): The Ethereum address of the recipient of the transaction.
- `value` (`BigNumber`): The value of the transaction in wei.
- `gasPrice` (`BigNumber`): The gas price for the transaction.
- `gasLimit` (`BigNumber`): The gas limit for the transaction.
- `input` (`string`): The input data for the transaction.
- `contractAddress` (`string`): The Ethereum address of the contract created by the transaction.
- `logs` (`Log[]`): An array of `Log` objects representing the logs generated by the transaction.
- `status` (`number`): The status of the transaction (0 for failure, 1 for success).
