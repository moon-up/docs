### Properties

- `address` (`string`): The Ethereum address of the account.
- `balance` (`BigNumber`): The balance of the account.
- `nonce` (`number`): The nonce of the account.
- `transactions` (`Transaction[]`): An array of `Transaction` objects representing the transactions associated with the account.

## `Transaction`

The `Transaction` interface defines the structure of an object that contains information about a transaction.

### Properties

- `to` (`string`): The Ethereum address of the recipient of the transaction.
- `value` (`BigNumber`): The value of the transaction in wei.
- `data` (`BytesLike`): The data to include in the transaction.
- `gasLimit` (`BigNumber`): The gas limit for the transaction.
- `gasPrice` (`BigNumber`): The gas price for the transaction.
- `nonce` (`number`): The nonce for the transaction.

## `MoonSDKConfig`

The `MoonSDKConfig` interface defines the configuration options for a `MoonApi` instance.

### Properties

- `Auth` (`{ securityWorker: () => Promise<string> }`): An object that contains a `securityWorker` function, which is used to authenticate requests to the Moon API.

## `BigNumber`

The `BigNumber` class provides a way to represent large numbers in JavaScript.

### Methods

- `from(value: number | string | BigNumber): BigNumber`: Creates a new `BigNumber` instance from a number, string, or another `BigNumber` instance.

### Properties

- `static Zero`: A `BigNumber` instance representing the number 0.
- `static One`: A `BigNumber` instance representing the number 1.
- `static MaxUint256`: A `BigNumber` instance representing the maximum value of a 256-bit unsigned integer.

## `BytesLike`

The `BytesLike` type represents a sequence of bytes.

## `Log`

The `Log` interface defines the structure of an object that represents a log generated by a transaction.

### Properties

- `address` (`string`): The Ethereum address of the contract that generated the log.
- `topics` (`string[]`): An array of strings representing the topics associated with the log.
- `data` (`string`): A string representing the data associated with the log.

## `TransactionResponse`

The `TransactionResponse` interface defines the structure of an object that represents information about a transaction.

### Properties

- `hash` (`string`): The hash of the transaction.
- `nonce` (`number`): The nonce of the transaction.
- `blockHash` (`string`): The hash of the block containing the transaction.
- `blockNumber` (`number`): The number of the block containing the transaction.
- `transactionIndex` (`number`): The index of the transaction in the block.
- `from` (`string`): The Ethereum address of the sender of the transaction.
- `to` (`string`): The Ethereum address of the recipient of the transaction.
- `value` (`BigNumber`): The value of the transaction in wei.
- `gasPrice` (`BigNumber`): The gas price for the transaction.
- `gasLimit` (`BigNumber`): The gas limit for the transaction.
- `input` (`string`): The input data for the transaction.
- `contractAddress` (`string`): The Ethereum address of the contract created by the transaction.
- `logs` (`Log[]`): An array of `Log` objects representing the logs generated by the transaction.
- `status` (`number`): The status of the transaction (0 for failure, 1 for success).
